Title: Metformin Hydrochloride - Comprehensive Drug Profile

1. DRUG INFORMATION

Generic Name: Metformin Hydrochloride
Brand Names: Glucophage, Glucophage XR, Fortamet, Glumetza, Riomet
Drug Class: Biguanide antihyperglycemic agent
FDA Approval: December 29, 1994
Pregnancy Category: B (no evidence of fetal harm in animal studies)

2. MECHANISM OF ACTION

Metformin works through multiple mechanisms to lower blood glucose without causing hypoglycemia:

2.1 Hepatic Glucose Production
The primary mechanism is reduction of hepatic glucose output. Metformin activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which suppresses gluconeogenesis in the liver. This accounts for approximately 75% of its glucose-lowering effect.

2.2 Peripheral Glucose Uptake
Metformin enhances insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in skeletal muscle by increasing GLUT4 transporter translocation to the cell surface. This improves peripheral insulin sensitivity.

2.3 Intestinal Glucose Absorption
Metformin modestly delays intestinal glucose absorption, contributing to reduced postprandial glucose excursions.

2.4 GLP-1 Enhancement
Recent research has shown that metformin increases circulating levels of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), an incretin hormone that stimulates insulin secretion and suppresses glucagon release.

3. CLINICAL INDICATIONS

3.1 Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (Primary Indication)
Metformin is recommended as first-line pharmacotherapy for type 2 diabetes by virtually all major guidelines (ADA, EASD, AACE). The UKPDS trial demonstrated that metformin reduces:
- Diabetes-related death: 42% reduction
- All-cause mortality: 36% reduction
- Myocardial infarction: 39% reduction

3.2 Prediabetes Prevention
The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) showed metformin reduces the risk of progression to type 2 diabetes by 31% in high-risk individuals. It is particularly effective in younger patients (<60 years) with BMI ≥35.

3.3 Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)
While not FDA-approved for PCOS, metformin is commonly used off-label to improve menstrual regularity and ovulation. It reduces androgen levels and improves insulin resistance in PCOS patients.

3.4 Gestational Diabetes
The MiG trial (Metformin in Gestational diabetes) showed metformin was not associated with increased perinatal complications compared to insulin. However, some guidelines still prefer insulin as first-line treatment.

4. DOSING AND ADMINISTRATION

| Formulation | Starting Dose | Titration | Maximum Dose |
|------------|---------------|-----------|--------------|
| Immediate Release | 500 mg twice daily | Increase by 500 mg weekly | 2,550 mg/day |
| Extended Release | 500 mg once daily | Increase by 500 mg weekly | 2,000 mg/day |
| Liquid (Riomet) | 500 mg twice daily | Per physician | 2,550 mg/day |

Key dosing principles:
- Take with meals to minimize GI side effects
- Titrate slowly to improve tolerance
- Divide daily dose (IR formulation) for better GI tolerance
- Monitor renal function: eGFR ≥30 mL/min required

5. ADVERSE EFFECTS

5.1 Gastrointestinal (Most Common: 20-30%)
- Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal discomfort
- Usually transient (1-2 weeks) with slow titration
- Extended-release formulation better tolerated

5.2 Lactic Acidosis (Rare but Serious)
- Incidence: approximately 3-10 cases per 100,000 patient-years
- Risk factors: renal impairment (eGFR <30), hepatic disease, heart failure, excessive alcohol use, dehydration
- Mortality rate: approximately 50% when it occurs
- Symptoms: malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, altered consciousness

5.3 Vitamin B12 Deficiency
- Occurs in 5-10% of long-term users
- Mechanism: interference with calcium-dependent B12-intrinsic factor complex absorption in terminal ileum
- Recommendation: periodic B12 monitoring, especially with symptoms of neuropathy

6. DRUG INTERACTIONS

6.1 Contrast Media (Iodinated)
Metformin should be held at the time of or before iodinated contrast procedures in patients with eGFR 30-60, and should not be restarted until 48 hours after and renal function is confirmed stable.

6.2 Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors (Topiramate, Zonisamide)
These drugs reduce renal bicarbonate excretion and may increase the risk of lactic acidosis when combined with metformin.

6.3 Alcohol
Excessive alcohol intake potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients should limit alcohol consumption.

7. CONTRAINDICATIONS

- eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73m² (absolute)
- Acute or chronic metabolic acidosis, including diabetic ketoacidosis
- Known hypersensitivity to metformin
- Use caution if eGFR 30-45 mL/min (do not initiate; may continue at reduced dose)

8. EMERGING RESEARCH

8.1 Anti-Aging Properties
The TAME (Targeting Aging with Metformin) trial is investigating whether metformin can delay age-related diseases. Preclinical data suggests metformin activates AMPK and inhibits mTOR signaling, pathways implicated in aging.

8.2 Cancer Prevention
Epidemiological studies suggest metformin users have a 10-40% reduced risk of various cancers (breast, colorectal, pancreatic). Multiple mechanisms have been proposed, including AMPK activation, mTOR inhibition, and reduced insulin/IGF-1 signaling.

8.3 Cardiovascular Outcomes
Beyond glucose lowering, metformin has demonstrated independent cardiovascular benefits. The mechanisms include improved endothelial function, reduced oxidative stress, and anti-inflammatory effects.
